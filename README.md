## Overview

### The challenge
To create a multipage website as close to the design files as possible. The finished website should be responsive enabling the user to view the optimal layout on their device. The interactive elements will have hover states, and the user will be able to toggle between tabs on each page.

## My process

Started building the site with Semantic HTML, adding CSS custom properties with flexbox and grid to ensure the site was responsive. Started designing for small, 600px, screens then altering the design for larger screen sizes.

Then using media queries to create the layout for larger screen sizes ensure they were aesthetically pleasing so the user can easily navigate the website to find the information they are looking for.

Used a combination of flexbox and grid to achieve a responsive layout.

Used CSS custom properties to build the website and keep the CSS organized and less repetitive with easily remembered variable names, and build a cascade to make the CSS cleaner and less repetitive.

### What I learned
I learned a new way to handle different information on a webpage without creating individual HTML files. By using JS to create toggle between classes to show information or hide information based on user input.

### Continued development
JS- take all the markup used for the tabs in the HTML files and put it in JSON file and access the information from there instead of needing it in the markup.
