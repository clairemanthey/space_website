## Overview

### The challenge
To create a multipage website as close to the design files as possible. The finished website should be responsive enabling the user to view the optimal layout on their deviceâ€™s screen size. All interactive elements will have hover states on each page and toggle between the tabs on each page to view new information.

## My process

Built with Semantic HTML, CSS custom properties, flexbox, grid, and js
Started designing with a mobile first approach, beginning with screen sizes of 600 pixels and smaller. Then using media queries to create the layout for larger screen sizes ensure they were aesthetically pleasing so the user can find the information they are looking for easily.
Used semantic HTML to optimize SEO and make the accessible for all users

Used a combination of flexbox and grid for responsive design

Used CSS custom properties to build the website and keep the CSS organized and less repetitive with easily remembered variable names, and build a cascade to make the code cleaner and less repetitive.

Built as much as I could then watched the videos to make tweeks to get the final design as close to the design files as possible

### What I learned
I learned a new way to handle different information on a webpage without creating individual HTML files. By using JS to create toggle between classes to show information or hide information based on user input.

### Continued development
JS- take all the markup used for the tabs in the HTML files and put it in JSON file and access the information from there instead of needing it in the markup.
